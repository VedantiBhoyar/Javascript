# JavaScript Concepts - Weekly Breakdown

This repository contains JavaScript concepts structured into a weekly format to help you systematically learn . Each week covers fundamental  concepts.

## ðŸ“Œ Week 1 - Basics of JavaScript Execution & Typing

###  Call Stack**
- **Problems:** Debugging call stack issues, analyzing stack overflow scenarios.
- **Questions:** Explain the call stack, its role in JavaScript execution, and stack overflow.

###  Primitive Types**
- **Problems:** Manipulating and validating primitive types.
- **Questions:** Differentiate between primitive and reference types in JavaScript.

### Value Types and Reference Types**
- **Problems:** Analyze and manipulate value/reference behavior in functions.
- **Questions:** Explain why arrays are reference types and strings are not.

### Implicit, Explicit, Nominal, Structuring, and Duck Typing**
- **Problems:** Implement explicit type checks; use duck typing for dynamic operations.
- **Questions:** Compare implicit and explicit typing in JavaScript.

## ðŸ“Œ Week 2 - Scopes, Modules, and Equality Operators

###  == vs === vs typeof**
- **Problems:** Implement type checks with both equality operators.
- **Questions:** Why is `==` considered "loose" equality?

###  Function Scope, Block Scope, and Lexical Scope**
- **Problems:** Debug issues due to scope and closures.
- **Questions:** How does lexical scope differ from function scope?

## ðŸ“Œ Week 3 - Asynchronous JavaScript & Performance

###  Message Queue and Event Loop**
- **Problems:** Analyze asynchronous task execution.
- **Questions:** Describe the event loop and how it works.


###  JavaScript Engines**
- **Problems:** Debug issues in different engines like V8 or SpiderMonkey.
- **Questions:** How do JavaScript engines optimize code execution?

###  Bitwise Operators, Typed Arrays, and Array Buffers**
- **Problems:** Manipulate binary data using typed arrays.
- **Questions:** What are use cases for bitwise operators in JavaScript?

### **Additional Topics:**
- DOM and Layout Trees
- Factories and Classes
- `this`, `call`, `apply`, and `bind`
- `new`, Constructor, `instanceof`, and Instances

## ðŸ“Œ Week 4 - Advanced JavaScript Concepts

### **Prototype & Functional Programming**
- Prototype Inheritance and Prototype Chain
- `Object.create` and `Object.assign`
- `map`, `reduce`, `filter`

### **Functional Concepts & Event Handling**
- Pure Functions, Side Effects, State Mutation, and Event Propagation
- Closures

### **Async Programming & Code Organization**
- Collections and Generators
- Promises
- `async/await`

### **Software Design Principles**
- Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Code Reuse
